Spacemacs
=============
* [Configuration](http://thume.ca/howto/2015/03/07/configuring-spacemacs-a-tutorial/)
* [Changing Colors](http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/01/emacs-basics-changing-the-background-color/)


Why I gave up on vim/neovim?
==========================

1. The process would stop if external shell command was called.
2. Less stable then Emacs, when used in a terminal emulator.
